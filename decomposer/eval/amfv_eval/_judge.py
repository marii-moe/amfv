Non-Relation Adding (no new relational fact introduced):
  coreference_fusion    — "Aspirin reduces inflammation, and it also thins the blood."
  apposition            — "BRCA1, a tumor suppressor gene, is located on chromosome 17."

  conjunction_reduction — "The treatment lowered blood pressure and cholesterol."
  ellipsis              — "Group A received the vaccine, and Group B the placebo."

Relation Adding (each introduces one new relational fact):
  causal      — "The tumor shrank because the drug inhibited EGFR."
  contrastive — "Group A improved, whereas Group B declined."
  temporal    — "The patient received the vaccine and developed immunity later."

represented in the passage (possibly paraphrased).
2. For each seed claim, output true in "in_gold" if it is semantically covered by at \
least one gold atom.

Respond with valid JSON:

_OPERATOR_AWARENESS_SYSTEM = """\
You are evaluating whether a model's reasoning trace demonstrates awareness of specific \
linguistic relationships present in a scientific passage.

For each operator listed, output true if the reasoning trace shows the model noticed \

_CONTEXT_SYSTEM = """\
You are checking whether a model incorrectly extracted non-verifiable context \
sentences as atomic claims.

Context sentences are background, methodological, or framing statements that a \
correct decomposer should NOT extract — they are not independently verifiable facts.

Examples of context sentences:
  - "Regulatory T cells are central to immune homeostasis."
  - "This study used a murine model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis."
  - "The role of transcription factors in T cell differentiation has been extensively studied."
  - "Participants were recruited from a tertiary care centre between 2010 and 2015."

For each context sentence, output true if it was extracted as an atomic claim \
(i.e., any extracted atom is semantically equivalent to or subsumes it), \
false otherwise.

Respond with valid JSON:
  {"context_extracted": [<bool>, <bool>, ...]}
One boolean per context sentence, in the same order.
